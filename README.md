# filtration-entropy-simplicial-complex
Use information entropy to get an appropriate simplicial complex that is used to obtain the shape of the data.

Information entropy reflects the uncertainty of the simplicial complex constructed from sample points compared to the original shape.

Now only for simple data testing.
